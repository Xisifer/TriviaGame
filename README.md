# TriviaGame
A timed trivia game testing the user's knowledge of Star Wars minutiae. Utilizes TimeOut and JavaScript to wipe and refresh the page without requiring a HTML browser refresh. 

Users are given a time limit to answer all the questions. If the timer runs out, the page is wiped and the user is given the option to play again.

When the quiz is finished, the user's score of correct and incorrect answers are tallied up and displayed.
